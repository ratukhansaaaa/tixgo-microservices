# Example cloudflared config. BT will typically run the tunnel and create DNS routes
# If you run cloudflared on the STB instead, create a tunnel and credentials, then
# place the tunnel credentials JSON on the STB and update credentials-file path.

# Replace <TUNNEL_ID> with the UUID returned by `cloudflared tunnel create <name>`
# and update the credentials-file path to where the JSON is stored on the STB.

# Example:
# tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
# credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json
#
# ingress:
#  - hostname: dina.theokaitou.my.id
#    service: http://identity:8000
#  - hostname: ratu.theokaitou.my.id
#    service: http://attendance:8000
#  - service: http_status:404

# Note: If BT handles the routing/tunnel, you do not need to run cloudflared.
